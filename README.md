Simple web app created in TypeScript that enables connecting MIDI devices and sound wave synthesis with frequency based on the inputs.

Main features:
- MIDI device connection and input handling
- creating desired sound waves by adding primitives (square, sawtooth, triangle, sine) with adjustable amplitudes and shifts
- synthesizing created waves to speaker output
- oscilloscope visualization
